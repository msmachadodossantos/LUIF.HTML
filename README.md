# Light User Interface Framework for HTML

## Summary
This project aims to provide a platform for building user interfaces that activate only the 
necessary features of the respective HTML document.

The HTML document written on this platform will exploit most of the features standardized by the 
WHATWG (https://whatwg.org/) for web browsers.

When deployed, the developer of this document will be able to manually run the 
_Tree shake_ technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking), thereby increasing the 
Google Lighthouse score (https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) for this document.
