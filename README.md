# Light User Interface Framework for HTML

## Summary
This project aims to provide a platform for building user interfaces that load only the 
necessary assets for a respective HTML document.

The HTML document written on this platform will exploit most of the features standardized by the 
WHATWG (https://whatwg.org/) for web browsers.

When deployed, the developer of this document will be able to manually run the 
_Tree shake_ technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking), thereby increasing the 
Google Lighthouse score (https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) for this document.
